<h1><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Adrian Wible" />The Life of Adrian</h1>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>I am married and have four beautiful children - three girls and a boy.
My oldest, the girls, are from a previous marriage and live with their mother in Florida; their ages: 17, 13, and 11.
My son is 8 years old.
</p>
<p>
I was born in New York and moved around a great deal as a child; by the time I earned my undergraduate degree at age 21, I had moved 20 times, but was mostly raised in South Florida.
</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I earned a <b>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University</b> in 1986.
Northeastern was the birthplace of cooperative education in 1908; Co-Op assignments were required but stretched the degree timeframe out over five years instead of the normal four.
I spent all of my co-op assignments at IBM in various locations: White Plains, NY, Boca Raton, FL, Cambridge, MA.
I highly recommend co-op programs to others.
For me, I know that I hit the ground running when I joined IBM out of college.
</p>
<p>
I got a bit frustrated in my career at one point - working on OS/2 and other IBM products that failed in the marketplace.
I realized, however, that I did not have the tools to understand whether or not a product was destined for success.
For this reason, I went to business school to earn an MBA.
I earned an <b>MBA from The University of Texas</b> through the Executive MBA program in 1999.
The executive program is geared towards allowing professionals to keep working and attend biweekly classes on Friday/Saturday.
It sounds lovely, until you dig more deeply into the project assignments that required between 20 and 30 hours of work a week.
My intention was not necessarily to get into management, but to understand business.
Alas, it lead me out of software development and towards more managerial responsibilities.
